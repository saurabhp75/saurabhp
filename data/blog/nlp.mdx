## Bag-of-Words Model :

- no order of words
- just count the occurence of words

Convert text to word count vectors with **CountVectorizer**.
Both tokenize a collection of text documents and build a vocabulary of known words

Convert text to word frequency vectors with **TfidfVectorizer**.

- Term Frequency: This summarizes how often a given word appears within a document.
- Inverse Document Frequency: This downscales words that appear a lot across documents.

Convert text to unique integers with **HashingVectorizer**.

- one way hash of words to convert them to integers
